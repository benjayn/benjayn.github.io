# Project 1
The goal of this project was to create an interactive typeface. I chose the Univers typeface in a Black Extended style because it’s bold and striking appearance makes it visually impactful. The concept involves converting the typeface into a dot-based design. When you hover over it with the mouse, the dots become larger within a small radius around the cursor.

I’m pleased with how the effect turned out, but I had hoped to fill the entire font with dots to make the effect even stronger. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a solution to achieve that effect. Despite this limitation, I’m still happy with the final result.


# Project 2
The goal of the second project was to create a design "misuse." I decided to design a tab inspired by old-school web design, featuring pixelated graphics. The tab duplicates an reappears whenever the user tries to click on it.

I wasn’t entirely sure how to implement the design at first, so I styled it in Illustrator and connected a PNG file to the code. To complete the functionality, I added an invisible box over the button, ensuring that users would continuously try to click it, but will never succeed.
